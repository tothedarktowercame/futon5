! conclusion:
  Uplift treats recurring motifs as promotable operators: scan genotypes for
  repeated windows, decay/persist counts, and reinforce the promoted motifs so
  they become callable transformations across layers (MMCA, CT, or narrative
  agents).

  + IF:
    A pattern emits stable micro-motifs—sliding windows of sigils that recur
    with frequency above `:freq_thresh` across successive observations.

  + HOWEVER:
    Without a generic lift, these motifs stay buried; other futons cannot refer
    to them, and specialised uplifts (like the cyber-ant pipeline) have nothing
    to inherit from.

  + THEN:
    Use the Futon5 `uplift-operator`: gather motif windows (`:window_size`),
    decay counts, promote motifs once they cross the frequency threshold, and
    reinforce the genotype with those motifs at act-time so they become
    executable operators. Track the promoted set for downstream tooling.

  + BECAUSE:
    Uplift makes “motif → operator” a first-class story, so specialisations can
    simply bind their pattern narratives to this operator rather than inventing
    new machinery.
