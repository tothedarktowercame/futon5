! conclusion:
  A facet is a two-layer metapattern: the generic layer defines the loop
  contract (observation schema, latent drives, policy slots), and the binding
  layer instantiates those slots for a specific species/domain.

  + IF:
    You want a Futon3 pattern to power multiple agents (ants, graph walkers,
    proof scouts) without rewriting narrative or losing testability.

  + HOWEVER:
    When generic patterns reach into domain-specific quantities (food, pheromone,
    white-streak) they stop being reusable; if you strip them out entirely the
    code loses grounding and goldens.

  + THEN:
    Define a facet ABI with four pillars: (a) observation schema (slot names,
    types, ranges), (b) latent/drive variables, (c) action vocabulary, (d)
    tunable parameters + invariants. Store this ABI in Futon5 (generic), and
    supply bindings from Futon2/other clients that map the slots to concrete
    fields plus fixtures.

  + BECAUSE:
    This preserves both semantic fidelity (bindings with goldens) and reuse
    (invariants stay constant). Later, LLM-based generators can implement new
    bindings as long as they satisfy the facet interface.

  + NEXT:
    next[Refactor existing ant patterns (e.g. hunger↔precision, white-space) to
         publish their facet ABI + ant binding, then attempt a second binding
         (e.g. a graph forager) to prove the split works.]
