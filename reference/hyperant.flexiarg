! conclusion:
  Hyper-ants are AIF-inspired agents whose terrain is text. They chain the
  lifted ant metapatterns (white-space scout, hunger↔precision, cargo discipline)
  to crawl flexiarg narratives and produce facet ABIs.

  + IF:
    You need to convert a Futon3 pattern description into a reusable facet +
    binding, using the same explore/exploit instincts the ants honed on the grid.

  + HOWEVER:
    Without a hyper-ant story, you hand-wave the conversion; there is no agentic
    process that says “follow novelty in the text, deposit schema slots, clamp
    when stalls happen,” so the uplift pipeline stays manual.

  + THEN:
    Equip the hyper-ant with three borrowed instincts:
      * **川 white-space scout**: follow textual novelty (unused slots) and leave
        “trail marks” on clauses that map to ABI fields.
      * **义 hunger↔precision**: treat missing facet slots as hunger, adjust tau to
        focus or widen the textual search.
      * **载 cargo discipline**: when a clause has been picked up (cargo) but not
        deposited into the ABI, clamp return behaviour until a binding is written.
    The agent emits a trail (string diagram) showing which sentences fed which
    facet slots.

  + BECAUSE:
    This makes the abstraction concrete: hyper-ants are an explicit agent that
    runs the explore/exploit loop over text, linking Futon3 narratives to Futon5
    operators and onward to Futon2 bindings.
