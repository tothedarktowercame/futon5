! conclusion:
  Replace the literal “queen reserve” with a general accumulator: a shared
  budget that agents deposit into or withdraw from (insight, attention, activation).
  Hunger/precision dynamics reference this accumulator rather than food alone.

  + IF:
    You have multi-agent systems (ants, cyberants, graph walkers) that need a
    shared signal for when to exploit, conserve, or explore.

  + HOWEVER:
    The current queen logic is tied to food consumption; it doesn’t generalise
    to graph activation, sound improvisation energy, or attention budgets.

  + THEN:
    Introduce an accumulator facet with slots: `:initial`, `:spend-rate`,
    `:deposit-events`, `:grace-ticks`, `:panic-boost`. Agents update this pool
    after every action (deposit when they “return” useful insight, spend on
    upkeep), and the hunger/precision coupling uses its level instead of literal
    food reserves.

  + BECAUSE:
    This keeps the colony dynamics universal: any multi-agent practice can share
    an accumulator pattern (attachment energy, activation, budget) and reuse the
    same AIF loop for regulation.

         super-ants inherit the same queen logic.]
