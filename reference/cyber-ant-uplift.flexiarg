! conclusion:
  The cyber-ant uplift specialises the generic Futon5 `UpliftOperator`: Futon3
  pattern descriptions become Futon5 operator specs, then flash into Futon2
  simulations as `:aif-config` overrides for the `:cyber` species.

  + IF:
    You need reproducible cyber-ants whose behaviour is documented in Futon3’s
    library but executed inside Futon2’s war sim.

  + HOWEVER:
    Without the uplift bridge, those textual patterns remain lore; Futon2 can’t
    ingest flexiarg directly, and Futon5 doesn’t know which operator should
    handle momentary promotions.

  + THEN:
    Assemble the specialisation pipeline:
      1. `library/ants/*.flexiarg` describe the behaviours (baseline loop,
         white-space scout, hunger↔precision).
      2. `resources/futon5/cyber_ants.edn` binds each narrative to concrete
         `:aif` overrides and tags them for `UpliftOperator`.
      3. `src/futon5/cyber_ants.clj` hydrates those entries, exposing hydrated
         configs + narratives while delegating motif promotion to the generic
         uplift operator.
      4. Futon2 depends on this namespace via `ants.cyber`, attaching the
         generated config to every `:cyber` ant.
      5. `aif/core` merges the override into the per-ant active inference loop,
         so the simulator “speaks” the pattern verbatim.

  + BECAUSE:
    Specialising the general uplift keeps all three futons honest: Futon3
    authors see their pattern flashed, Futon5 records which uplift route was
    taken, and Futon2 runs the resulting cyber-ants without bespoke wiring.
