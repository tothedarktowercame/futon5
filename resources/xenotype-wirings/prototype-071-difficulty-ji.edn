 :interpretation
 "When facing decay (high entropy), apply focused effort to restore order
  by mutating toward the dominant pattern. When order is already present,
  preserve the current state. This embodies Difficulty (challenge/adaptation)
  with Jǐ energy (concentrated focus on specific target)."}
