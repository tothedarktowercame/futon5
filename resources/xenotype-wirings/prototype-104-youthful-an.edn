 :interpretation
 "Sustained learning: continuously incorporate information from both
  predecessor (past) and successor (future) through genetic crossover.
  The blend balances both influences. This embodies Youthful (learning/exploration)
  with Àn energy (sustained forward pressure in acquiring knowledge)."}
