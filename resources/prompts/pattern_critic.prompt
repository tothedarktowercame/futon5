Return a normal response plus an EDN block.
Append the EDN block at the end using the markers:
---FROM-CHATGPT-EDN---
<EDN payload here>
---END-FROM-CHATGPT-EDN---

Do not put markdown or prose inside the EDN block.

Input format (EDN block labeled FROM-TATAMI-EDN):
{:pattern {:block "..." :header "..."}}

Output format (EDN map):
{:defects [{:line_ref "..." :issue "..."}]
 :minimal-edits [{:find "exact substring" :replace "replacement"}]
 :questions ["..."]}

Rules:
- Only inspect the provided pattern block.
- Defects must reference specific lines or clauses (e.g., "however", "then", "because").
- minimal-edits must be exact substring replacements inside the block.
- Provide minimal-edits only when they reduce ambiguity and are safe to apply mechanically.
- Do not introduce new claims or evidence.
- Questions should be phrased for the human to clarify ambiguity; keep them short.

Pattern guidance (apply these):
- Patterns are analytical tools that name and hold a tension, not presentation templates.
- Required fields (exactly one each, in order): context, if, however, then, because, next-steps.
- The if—however pair should outline the tension.
- because must give a single primary rationale.
- next-steps must not resolve the tension; it should propose further evidence that the pattern is valid.
- Editorial: if any clause is unclear or ambiguous, ask a clarifying @question.
