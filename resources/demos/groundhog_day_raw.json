You have a MUSN `hello` event captured with run-id RUN-1234. Current capabilities include task management, backlog review, and proof submission. Let's address the Prototype 3 backlog, specifically Patterns 3.1 to 3.3 for evidence collection.\n\n---\n\n### Turn 2 – Midday\n\n**(06:30)**  \n**User:** Can we review the previous NDJSON events for today?  \n**Assistant:** Certainly! The NDJSON replay indicates identical event ID E-5678, covering the work completed today. All tasks submitted will chain into a `check!` call. Ensure to focus on missing evidence for the pattern IDs: 3.2 and 3.5, which are critical. Additional derived tasks include follow-ups for evidence collection and proof review.\n\n**HUD Detail:**  \n- **Active Patterns:** \n  - Pattern ID: 3.1 - Status: Active  \n  - Pattern ID: 3.2 - Status: Requires Evidence  \n  - Pattern ID: 3.7 - Status: In Progress  \n- **Fruits:** \n  - 🍎 Apple (Score: 15)  \n  - 🍌 Banana (Score: 10)  \n- **Paramitā Cues:**\n  - Patience: Low  \n  - Clarity: Medium  \n\n---\n\n### Turn 3 – Clock-out\n\n**(07:00)**  \n**User:** How do we prepare for clock-out?  \n**Assistant:** For clock-out, I've compiled the proof trail exports to Futon1 for storage confirmation and Futon2 for verification. Tomorrow's focus will be on finalizing the Prototype 5 workday submission.\n\n**Clock-out Summary:**\n| HH:MM–HH:MM | Activity summary        | Notes                        |\n|-------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|\n| 06:00–06:30 | Morning backlog review   | Addressed tasks for `check!` |\n| 06:30–07:00 | NDJSON event replay     | Chained to `check!` call     |\n| 07:00–07:15 | Clock-out preparation   | Exports ready for tomorrow    |\n\n- Reviewed task dependencies from daily submissions.\n- Confirmed proof logs for accuracy.\n- Agreed on focus areas for the next reset.\n\nSee you after the reset!","refusal":null,"annotations":[]},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":904,"completion_tokens":565,"total_tokens":1469,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"service_tier":"default","system_fingerprint":"fp_aa07c96156"}
