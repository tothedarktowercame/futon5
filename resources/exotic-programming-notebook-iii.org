* Motivating Finding: I Ching Predicts EoC

** The discovery (2026-01-17)

We asked: do the M17 EoC sigils land in a predictable region of parameter space?

Using the I Ching hexagram framework as a lens:
- ䷀ 乾 (Qián, "The Creative"): pure yang, maximal intervention, high update-prob
- ䷁ 坤 (Kūn, "The Receptive"): pure yin, minimal intervention, low update-prob
- ䷊ 泰 (Tài, "Peace"): dynamic balance, creative serves receptive, mid-range params

We defined the "泰 zone" as: ~update-prob ∈ [0.3, 0.7]~ and ~match-threshold ∈ [0.3, 0.7]~.

** Empirical test

#+begin_src
Sigil  update-prob  match-threshold  泰 Zone?   M17 Behavior
─────  ───────────  ───────────────  ────────   ────────────
工     0.50         0.44             YES ✓      Stable EoC (M17a)
土     0.25         0.44             just out   EoC, less stable
一     0.25         0.11             no (坤)    limit case
乐     1.00         0.89             no (乾)    limit case
#+end_src

** Result

*工 - the sigil that showed the most stable EoC in M17a - lands squarely in the 泰 zone.*

The "trivial" sigils 一 and 乐 aren't kill-switch/no-op; they're the limit cases
(坤 and 乾 directions) that 泰 interpolates between.

** Interpretation

The I Ching hexagram structure, interpreted as a parameter space over
intervention/observation balance, predicts which exotypes produce edge-of-chaos
dynamics. This is not mysticism - it's pattern transfer validated.

Leibniz saw the I Ching as confirmation of binary arithmetic and sought
universal patterns of reasoning across domains. We appear to have found one:
a 3000-year-old framework predicting 8-bit sigil behavior in CA simulations.

** Implications

1. The 泰 zone is real and findable via parameter mapping.
2. Other hexagrams should predict other regime types.
3. If transfer to ants works, this validates domain-general "patterns of improvisation."

See: ~futon3/library/iching/~ for full hexagram patterns with CT + ant + MMCA interpretations.

* Edge of Chaos (EoC) Hypotheses

EoC = Edge of Chaos.

** CA / Exotype hypotheses

- EoC emerges when exotype rewrite pressure is strong enough to preserve diversity
  but not so strong that it collapses into “magma” or static attractors.
- EoC corresponds to exotypes that preserve multiple competing local motifs rather
  than enforcing a single attractor (metastable interactions).
- Phenotype coupling is a key dial: soft constraints (not hard resets) sustain EoC.
- Certain sigil families may cluster near EoC (controlled mix + low rotation + mid thresholds).
- Nomination gaps suggest EoC lives on a thin manifold; robustness across contexts
  is part of exotype “goodness.”

** CA / Exotype validation ideas

- Sweep `update-prob` × `mix-mode` × `match-threshold` to map the EoC manifold.
- Track stability across context schedules (lock-0/1/2) to quantify fragility.
- Compare EoC candidates by robustness to perturbations vs degeneracy rates.

* EoC ↔ Cyberants hypotheses

- Both domains reward sustained adaptability: EoC in CA parallels “stable survival
  + continued exploration” in ants.
- EoC sigils may encode “controlled perturbation” that maps to exploration–
  exploitation balance in ant policies.
- Robust EoC exotypes should generalize across contexts; analogously, cyberants
  should generalize across grid layouts and food distributions.
- EoC-driving morphisms could become policy adjustment operators (mode shifts,
  hunger/tau coupling), acting as regime shifters in ants.
- Caveat: some EoC sigils may amplify churn without utility; cross-domain checks
  should test correlation with survival/score improvements.

** EoC ↔ Cyberants validation ideas

- Pick a small EoC-exotype set and test against baseline AIF ants for survival.
- Measure transfer: do EoC sigils improve score stability across varied maps?
- Identify “busy but useless” cases where EoC ≠ ant utility.

* Mission 0 — Self-Transfer: CT-Native EoC Discovery

Goal: build MMCA-native xenotypes expressed in category theory that can
reliably find, recognize, and produce Edge of Chaos effects from any
starting configuration.

** The foundational problem

All other missions depend on transferring "good" patterns to external
domains (ants, music, Q&A, math). But what makes a pattern "good"?

Current answer: Joe inspects visually and knows EoC when he sees it.
Computational proxies (entropy, diversity) approximate this, but they're
only proxies.

For exotic programming to be a *method* rather than an art, we need:
1. Programmatic EoC recognition that matches human judgment
2. CT-formalized selection that guides any configuration toward EoC

** The self-transfer insight

Instead of: exotypes → external domain (ants) → xenotype evaluation
Do: exotypes → MMCA itself → CT-expressed xenotype evaluation

The xenotype for MMCA *is* MMCA — the system evaluates itself.
The CT formalism describes both the exotypes AND the evaluation criterion.

** Two layers to develop

*** Analysis layer: Recognizing EoC

Current proxies:
- Entropy (spatial, temporal)
- Motif diversity
- Lyapunov-like stability measures
- Regime classification (collapse, chaos, EoC, static)

What's missing:
- CT characterization of EoC (what morphism structure does it have?)
- Boundary detection (where exactly does EoC end and chaos begin?)
- Robustness measure (how stable is this EoC across perturbations?)

Hypothesis: EoC has a specific CT signature — perhaps it's where:
- Identity and projection are in convex combination (泰 tensor)
- Morphisms neither collapse nor diverge
- The category has "interesting" but finite structure

*** Program layer: Guiding to EoC

Current approach: evolutionary search, hope to land in 泰 zone

What's needed:
- Active guidance: given current state, which direction leads to EoC?
- Hexagram navigation: use 乾/坤/泰 structure to steer
- Gradient signal: not just "is this EoC?" but "how far from EoC?"

Analogy: PSR/PUR from P4NG (see ~/code/p4ng/main.tex), specialized to CT and MMCA

- *PSR (Pattern Selection Record)*: "Which exotype/sigil do we select, and why now?"
  Captures the reasoning for selection, not just the outcome.
  In MMCA: "given this sigil set, we selected these exotypes because X"

- *PUR (Pattern Use Record)*: "What happened when we applied it?"
  Captures outcomes, evidence, and implications for future use.
  In MMCA: "we applied these exotypes and EoC/not-EoC resulted"

Together they form a learning loop. Crucially:

*"Rule 110 all the time" produces EoC in the phenotype but is anti-EoC
at the genotype level.* We want EoC across ALL levels — genotype,
phenotype, exotype, xenotype. The PSR must capture WHY a selection was
made, not just that it locally produces interesting dynamics.

This means Mission 0 isn't just "find EoC" but "find EoC-producing
*processes* that are themselves EoC-like" — creative selection, not
static rules.

** The fusion metaphor

Nuclear fusion: confine plasma at right temperature/pressure → energy release
EoC fusion: confine dynamics at right intervention/observation balance → emergence

The 泰 zone is the "ignition point" — parameters where:
- update-prob ∈ [0.3, 0.7]
- match-threshold ∈ [0.3, 0.7]
- The system sustains itself rather than collapsing or exploding

If we can reliably reach and maintain this zone:
- Any sigil set becomes potentially useful
- EoC becomes reproducible, not accidental
- The method generalizes to other domains

** CT formalization of EoC (sketch)

#+begin_src
;; EoC as categorical structure
(defn eoc-signature [category]
  {:morphism-count    ; not too few (static), not too many (chaos)
   :fixed-points      ; some but not all states are attractors
   :composition-depth ; chains of morphisms exist but terminate
   :symmetry-breaking ; structure emerges from uniformity
   })

;; 泰 tensor interpretation
;; M = α|target⟩⟨target| + (1-α)I, where α ∈ (0.3, 0.7)
;; Partial projection: some convergence, some preservation
#+end_src

** Validation approach

1. *Calibration*: Collect Joe's EoC judgments on many runs
2. *Feature extraction*: Compute all candidate metrics
3. *Model fitting*: Find combination that predicts Joe's judgments
4. *CT interpretation*: Express the winning model in CT terms
5. *Guidance test*: Can the CT model steer toward EoC?

Success criterion: System finds EoC as reliably as Joe does,
and can explain *why* a configuration is/isn't EoC in CT terms.

** Connection to other missions

Mission 0 is foundational:
- Mission A-F transfer patterns to external domains
- But *which* patterns? The ones Mission 0 identifies as EoC
- Without reliable EoC detection, we're transferring blindly

The hexagram structure (泰 zone) is our current best theory.
Mission 0 is about *proving* this theory computationally.

** Implementation modes

*** Easy mode: Long batches with ratchet

- Run MMCA for extended generations with existing ratchet mechanism
- Let selection pressure find EoC naturally
- Validation: does the ratchet converge to 泰 zone?
- Minimal new infrastructure needed

*** Medium mode: Ant battles as xenotype

- Periodically intersperse ant arena evaluation
- Top-K exotypes fight in colony wars every N generations
- Survival/stability metrics feed back to MMCA selection
- May already have wiring for this (check MMCA hook plan above)
- Question: what's the right evaluation frequency? Too often = slow,
  too rare = weak selection pressure

*** Hard mode: Evolutionary computing at xenotype level

- Not just using xenotypes as occasional evaluation
- *Evolving at the xenotype level itself*
- What this might look like:
  - Evolving the evaluation criteria (which metrics matter?)
  - Evolving the ant arena (map layouts, food distributions)
  - Evolving the transfer function (exotype → cyberant mapping)
  - Meta-evolution: xenotypes that produce good xenotypes
- This is "serious" because the search space explodes
- But also where the real gains might be — finding evaluation
  criteria we wouldn't have thought of

*** Bootstrap mode: Hexagrams as xenotype for octagrams

The inversion: I Ching doesn't compete with sigils — it *judges* them.

#+begin_src
Octagram (8-bit) → exotype → MMCA dynamics
                                 ↓
                    "Does this look like 泰? Or 否? Or 乾?"
                                 ↓
                    Hexagram-based fitness signal
                                 ↓
                    Guide octagram evolution
#+end_src

How it works:
- Octagrams are the exotype layer (256 raw sigils, random mutations)
- Hexagrams are the xenotype layer (64 semantic patterns that evaluate)
- An octagram producing 泰-like dynamics gets boosted
- An octagram producing 否-like dynamics gets penalized
- Pure 乾 (collapse) or pure 坤 (frozen) gets filtered

Why this helps:
- Don't need all 64 hexagrams interpreted — just the diagnostic ones
  (泰, 否, 乾, 坤, and a few key transition patterns)
- Ancient framework as evaluation criterion for modern search
- Tests whether hexagram structure captures something metrics miss

**** The lift: sigils → exotypes → hexagrams

Bootstrap phase uses hexagrams as fixed evaluators. Next step:
learn to *lift* octagram dynamics to hexagram classifications.

#+begin_src
sigil (8-bit) → exotype params → MMCA dynamics → hexagram label
     ↑                                               ↓
     └─────────── learned mapping ←──────────────────┘
#+end_src

If we can reliably lift sigils to hexagrams, we've learned:
- A compression: 256 sigils → 64 hexagram classes
- Semantic meaning: each class has 乾/坤/泰 interpretation
- Transfer structure: hexagram relationships predict sigil relationships

This is the PSR/PUR loop for exotypes:
- PSR: "We selected sigil X because it maps to hexagram Y"
- PUR: "Sigil X produced dynamics Z, which matches hexagram Y (or not)"
- Learning: refine the sigil→hexagram mapping based on evidence

**** The 6×6 matrix structure

The 36-bit exotype has natural structure:
- LEFT (8 bits): spatial input from left neighbor
- EGO (8 bits): self-state
- RIGHT (8 bits): spatial input from right neighbor
- NEXT (8 bits): temporal projection
- PHENOTYPE (4 bits): 3 parents + 1 offspring

This maps onto a 6×6 matrix:

#+begin_src
        1     2     3     4     5     6
      ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
   1  │ EGO │  R  │  R  │  R  │  R  │  R  │
      ├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
   2  │  L  │ EGO │  R  │  R  │  R  │  R  │
      ├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
   3  │  L  │  L  │NEXT │ P₁  │ P₁  │ P₁  │
      ├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
   4  │  L  │  L  │ P₁  │NEXT │ P₂  │ P₂  │
      ├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
   5  │  L  │  L  │ P₁  │ P₂  │NEXT │ P₃  │
      ├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
   6  │  L  │  L  │ P₁  │ P₂  │ P₃  │ OFF │
      └─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘

Diagonal:     [EGO, EGO, NEXT, NEXT, NEXT, OFFSPRING]
Below diag:   LEFT (spatial input from left)
Above diag:   RIGHT (spatial input from right)
Lower-right:  Phenotype parents (P₁, P₂, P₃)
Corner (6,6): Offspring bit
#+end_src

The hexagram lift is then literally the diagonal:

#+begin_src clojure
(defn exotype->6x6 [left ego right next phenotype]
  ;; Arrange 36 bits into 6×6 matrix with structure above
  ...)

(defn exotype-matrix->hexagram [M]
  (let [diag (diagonal M)]  ; 6 values
    (mapv #(if (yang? %) :yang :yin) diag)))
#+end_src

The diagonal captures:
- Lines 1-2: EGO (self-state, identity) — lower trigram base
- Lines 3-5: NEXT (temporal projection) — transition to upper trigram
- Line 6: OFFSPRING (what emerges) — top line, outcome

The off-diagonals (LEFT/RIGHT) provide spatial context that *conditions*
the diagonal but doesn't appear directly in the hexagram. This matches
the I Ching interpretation: the hexagram shows the state/trajectory,
the spatial context is the "situation" that produced it.

Compression ratio: 36 bits → 6 bits (exactly 6:1)
Structure preserved: diagonal = self/time, off-diagonal = space

** Implementation path (detailed)

1. *Judgment collection*
   - Joe labels 100+ MMCA runs as EoC / not-EoC / borderline
   - Record all metrics for each run
   - Build ground truth dataset

2. *Metric analysis*
   - Which metrics correlate with Joe's judgments?
   - Are there metrics we're missing?
   - What's the decision boundary?

3. *CT interpretation*
   - Express winning metrics in CT language
   - Define EoC as categorical property
   - Formalize the 泰 signature

4. *Guidance mechanism*
   - Given current state, compute "EoC gradient"
   - Suggest parameter adjustments
   - Test: does guidance improve EoC discovery rate?

5. *Self-application*
   - Use the EoC-finder to improve the EoC-finder
   - Meta-level: what's the EoC of EoC-finding?

** The prize

If Mission 0 succeeds:
- EoC becomes reproducible and explainable
- Transfer to other domains has solid foundation
- The method is teachable (not just "Joe's intuition")
- Exotic programming becomes a science, not an art

* Mission A — Cyberant Pattern Programs (Pilot)

Goal: validate that pattern-programmed cyberants can be compiled, run, and
evaluated reproducibly, and that the module wiring (policy/precision/sense/adapt)
matters.

** Protocol

1) Inputs
- Pattern ids with @ant-interpretation blocks (hexagrams in ~futon3/library/iching~).
- Optional base sigil for defaults.
- Program map: ~{:policy ... :precision ... :pattern-sense ... :adapt ...}~.

2) Compilation
- Use ~futon5.adapters.cyberant/pattern-program->cyberant~ to build a composite
  cyberant config.
- Record provenance per module (pattern id + title + source path).

3) Execution (ants sim)
- Fixed scenario (grid size, food layout, pheromone decay).
- Run length: 500 ticks (pilot), 10 seeds.
- Compare against baseline AIF ants and a "single-pattern" cyberant.

4) Evaluation
- Survival time (mean + variance).
- Food returned per tick.
- Pheromone efficiency (food per pheromone unit).
- Stability: variance of hunger/cargo over time.
- Qualitative: snapshot traces for a few seeds.

5) Logging + artifacts
- Save compiled cyberant EDN for each run.
- Save run summary table (CSV/EDN) with metrics and seed.
- Save one trace snapshot per condition (for visual inspection).

** Pilot matrix (first pass)

- Program A (EoC-driven):
  :policy iching/hexagram-44-gou
  :precision iching/hexagram-52-gen
  :pattern-sense iching/hexagram-57-xun
  :adapt iching/hexagram-43-guai

- Program B (cooling / restraint):
  :policy iching/hexagram-05-xu
  :precision iching/hexagram-52-gen
  :pattern-sense iching/hexagram-57-xun
  :adapt iching/hexagram-12-pi

- Baseline: AIF ants + single-pattern cyberant (choose one hexagram).

** Expected signal

- Program A should be more exploratory (higher movement, higher pheromone use).
- Program B should be more stable (lower variance, slower decay).
- If both beat baseline in survival, pattern-program wiring is validated.

Set used for the 50-run comparison:
- Hexagrams: 44 (gou), 57 (xun), 52 (gen), 43 (guai), 11 (tai)
- Sigils: 工 土 上 下 升

** Stacked 5-on-5 results (hex vs sigil)

Compiled stacking (merge after compile):
- Mean score: Hex 133.26 vs Sigil 140.80
- Win rate: Hex 3/10 vs Sigil 7/10

CT stacking (merge at module level):
- Mean score: Hex 135.00 vs Sigil 140.60
- Win rate: Hex 21/50 vs Sigil 29/50

Note: CT stacking materially improved hex win rate even though sigils still lead
on mean score. This supports the idea that diagram-level composition carries
useful signal.

** Next step

Use cyberant regimes as a xenotype: treat ant survival + stability metrics as
external evaluation signals for MMCA runs (cross-domain viability check).

** Xenotype sketch (ants → MMCA)

- Fixed horizon: T=200 ticks per run.
- Survival rate: fraction of runs where the queen survives to T.
- Early failure: time-to-queen-starvation (only when queen dies before T).
- Sustained return: food returned per tick (mean + variance).
- Stability: hunger + reserve variance (avoid brittle spikes).
- Exploration balance: pheromone efficiency + movement diversity.
- Robustness: variance across seeds/maps.

** Big-picture snapshot (where we are now)

- Exotypes (sigils) are operational and stable.
- Xenotypes now have a concrete instantiation via cyberant regimes.
- End-to-end pipeline works: patterns → cyberants → ant sim → metrics.
- Early evidence: sigil-based cyberants are ahead of hexagrams on the current set.
- Next integration task: plug ant xenotype scores into MMCA as a slow evaluator
  (every N exotype gens), using fixed-horizon metrics.

** MMCA hook plan (ant xenotype)

1) Trigger point
- Run ant xenotype every N exotype generations (e.g., N=100).
- Input: top-K exotypes (by current MMCA score) + a few random controls.

2) Adapter
- Map exotype → cyberant config (sigil-based by default).
- Optionally allow hexagram mapping as a comparison arm.

3) Battery
- Fixed horizon T=200 ticks.
- 3 maps × 5 seeds (15 runs per exotype).
- Record survival rate + early failure time + stability metrics.

4) Scoring
- Produce a xenotype score vector (not scalar) per exotype:
  {:survival-rate .. :early-fail-mean .. :return-rate .. :stability .. :robustness ..}
- Collapse to a conservative scalar only for culling (e.g., survival-rate gate).

5) Integration
- Penalize exotypes that consistently fail survival gate.
- Maintain a portfolio of xenotype-viable exotypes (top-K per regime).
- Log xenotype audits alongside exotype lineage for later analysis.

* Mission B — MMCA + Xenotype Discovery

Goal: determine whether cross-domain selection pressure (ant arena) helps MMCA
discover *better* EoC exotypes than internal metrics alone — and whether the
CT interpretation layer produces *explainable* knowledge.

** Core question

Does xenotype evaluation find EoC exotypes that MMCA alone would miss?

** Experimental design

*** Arm A (MMCA-only)

Run MMCA selection for N generations using only internal EoC metrics:
- Entropy (spatial + temporal)
- Motif diversity
- Lyapunov-like stability measures
- Robustness across context schedules

*** Arm B (MMCA + xenotype)

Same MMCA selection, but every K generations:
1. Take top-M exotypes (by MMCA score) + random controls
2. Run each through ant arena (15 runs: 3 maps × 5 seeds)
3. Compute xenotype score vector (survival, stability, return-rate, robustness)
4. Feed back: boost xenotype-viable exotypes, penalize failures

** Success criteria

*** Weak success
Arm B finds exotypes that are *as good* in MMCA but *better* in ants.
Interpretation: xenotype acts as tiebreaker among MMCA-equivalent candidates.

*** Strong success
Arm B finds exotypes that are *better in both domains*.
Interpretation: cross-domain selection discovers things MMCA alone misses.

*** Very strong success
Arm B finds exotypes in a *different region of parameter space* — ones MMCA
would never have explored using internal metrics alone.
Interpretation: ant arena reveals structure in the EoC manifold that MMCA
can't see. Xenotype isn't just a filter but a *search guide*.

** The explainability question

The parallel experiment (Codex, current):
- Tournament A: CT-level stacks (hexagram compositions at semantic level)
- Tournament B: compiled config merges (raw parameter blending)

This tests: *does the CT layer add explainable structure?*

Hypothesis: CT-level composition should produce:
1. More interpretable combinations (we can say *why* they work)
2. Better transfer to new domains (the semantic structure generalizes)
3. Possibly lower raw performance (interpretation overhead)

The xenotype test is the only way to know if (2) holds — raw MMCA metrics
can't distinguish "works here" from "works anywhere."

** Connection to 泰 finding

The I Ching discovery showed: semantic structure (hexagram framework) predicts
parameter zones (泰 ≈ EoC). This suggests the CT layer isn't just notation —
it's capturing something real about intervention/observation balance.

If xenotype selection + CT composition outperforms xenotype + raw params,
that's evidence the semantic layer is doing useful work.

** What we might learn

1. Whether xenotype feedback improves EoC discovery (validates cross-domain)
2. Whether CT interpretation adds value beyond parameter mapping
3. Which hexagrams/patterns are "universal" (work across domains) vs "local"
4. The shape of the EoC manifold as seen from multiple domains

** Implementation notes

- Reuse Mission A infrastructure (cyberant adapter, ant sim, metrics)
- Add MMCA callback hook for xenotype evaluation
- Log both arms with full lineage for post-hoc analysis
- Consider factorial: (MMCA-only, MMCA+xeno) × (CT-stack, raw-params)

* Mission C — Nonstarter Transfer (Speculative)

Goal: test whether the 泰 pattern (and hexagram structure generally) predicts
sustainable creative practice in the nonstarter/art market domain.

** The three-domain transfer hypothesis

If "patterns of improvisation" are real, the same structure should work across:

| Concept      | MMCA              | Ants                 | Nonstarters          |
|--------------+-------------------+----------------------+----------------------|
| 乾 (yang)    | update-prob=1.0   | forage-only, starve  | overbid, burnout     |
| 坤 (yin)     | update-prob=0.0   | passive trail-follow | underbid, stall      |
| 泰 (balance) | EoC zone          | gather-return cycle  | bid/clear rhythm     |
| Exotype      | sigil → params    | cyberant config      | practice regime      |
| Xenotype     | ant arena         | other colony (war)   | market feedback      |

** Nonstarter domain concepts

*** Exotype (internal practice regime)
- Bid rate: how often you propose/start new work
- Clear rate: how often you finish/ship
- Hold capacity: WIP limits, parallel projects
- Precision: how much market signal you attend to

*** Xenotype (external evaluation)
- Market clears: do your bids get accepted? (commissions, grants, sales)
- Survival: sustaining practice over time (not quitting)
- Stability: consistent output without boom/bust cycles
- GFE accumulation: genuine frontier expansion (new capabilities, reach)
- Robustness: works across contexts (commissions, spec, grants, day-job)

** The 泰 prediction

Pure 乾 artist: starts everything, finishes nothing, burns out
Pure 坤 artist: waits for permission, never ships, stalls out
泰 artist: balanced bid/clear cycle, sustainable output, survives

The 泰 zone in nonstarter terms:
- bid-rate ∈ [0.3, 0.7] (not overbidding, not underbidding)
- clear-rate ∈ [0.3, 0.7] (finishing enough to learn, not rushing)
- market-attention ∈ [0.3, 0.7] (responsive but not reactive)

** Hexagram interpretations for practice

Some candidate mappings:

- ䷊ 泰 (11): Dynamic balance — the sustainable practice regime
- ䷋ 否 (12): Obstruction — when bid/clear cycle breaks down
- ䷀ 乾 (1): Pure assertion — good for launches, bad for maintenance
- ䷁ 坤 (2): Pure reception — good for learning phases, bad if stuck
- ䷄ 需 (5): Waiting — strategic pause, not stall
- ䷝ 離 (30): Clinging/Clarity — focused execution sprint

** Testing approach

Unlike MMCA and ants, we can't run controlled experiments on humans.
But we can:

1. Retrospective analysis: map past practice regimes to hexagrams,
   check if 泰-like periods correlate with sustainable output

2. Prospective tracking: use bid/clear logging (futon5a/track.clj)
   to monitor practice regime, watch for 乾/坤 drift

3. Intervention design: when stuck, consult hexagram for diagnosis
   (am I too 乾? too 坤?) and prescribed shift

4. Cross-check: do the same patterns that work in ant tournaments
   predict good practice regimes? (indirect validation)

** The meta-question

If transfer works across all three domains, what does that mean?

Hypothesis: the intervention/observation balance (yang/yin, creative/receptive)
is a *universal* structure that applies wherever agents interact with
environments. The I Ching encoded this 3000 years ago; we're rediscovering
it through computational experiments.

This would validate "exotic programming" as a genuine methodology:
patterns discovered in one domain (CA) transfer to others (ants, art)
through the CT interpretation layer.

** Connection to job search

The "sustainability meta-probe" (job search as nonstarter) is itself
a test case:

- Too 乾: spray applications everywhere, no focus, burnout
- Too 坤: wait for perfect opportunity, never apply, stall
- 泰: balanced search with clear criteria, sustainable pace

GFE evaluation of job opportunities follows the same pattern:
attend to market signal (offers, interviews) but don't be purely reactive.

* Mission D — Music Domain Transfer

Goal: extend the pattern transfer framework to music — both for *analyzing*
existing music (aesthetic lens) and *creating* new music (composition tool).

** Existing infrastructure (from AGENTS.md)

FUTON5 already plans music integration:

- Milestone B: Alda + Overtone integration
- Section 4.1: "Let operators sound their transformations"
- "Audible debugging" of pattern transforms
- Link CA states to sound patterns (sonification)

** Audio display for EoC

Immediate goal: *hear* edge-of-chaos rather than just see it.

Sonification mapping ideas:
- Entropy → pitch range (low entropy = narrow, high = wide)
- Motif diversity → harmonic complexity
- Update frequency → rhythm density
- Spatial clustering → stereo positioning
- Regime transitions → timbral shifts

This gives a direct perceptual channel for EoC detection. Some dynamics
might be easier to hear than see (e.g., subtle phase relationships).

** The four-domain table (updated)

| Concept      | MMCA              | Ants                 | Nonstarters          | Music                |
|--------------+-------------------+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------|
| 乾 (yang)    | update-prob=1.0   | forage-only, starve  | overbid, burnout     | overplaying, no space|
| 坤 (yin)     | update-prob=0.0   | passive trail-follow | underbid, stall      | underplaying, sparse |
| 泰 (balance) | EoC zone          | gather-return cycle  | bid/clear rhythm     | call/response groove |
| Exotype      | sigil → params    | cyberant config      | practice regime      | performance params   |
| Xenotype     | ant arena         | other colony (war)   | market feedback      | listener/band response|

** Aesthetic analysis: Neubauten vs Coleman

Both are 泰-zone artists operating at edge-of-chaos, but in different parameter spaces:

*** Einstürzende Neubauten
- Industrial materials, extreme timbres
- 乾 on *texture* (aggressive intervention on sound)
- 泰 on *form* (structured chaos, not pure noise)
- High update-prob on timbre, moderate on rhythm
- Xenotype: audience endurance, mosh pit dynamics

*** Ornette Coleman
- Harmolodic freedom, melodic assertion
- 泰 on *melody* (free but coherent)
- High reception on *group dynamics* (listening-based improv)
- Moderate update-prob, high match-threshold (melodic coherence)
- Xenotype: band response, collective groove

The hexagram lens reveals: *where* is each artist's 泰 zone? What parameters
are they balancing? This is more precise than "they're both experimental."

** Composition/improvisation tool

Use hexagrams as:

1. *Diagnostic*: "This section feels too 乾, needs more 坤"
2. *Prescriptive*: "Try hexagram 57-xùn here: gentle persistence"
3. *Structural*: "A = 乾 (attack), B = 坤 (sustain), C = 泰 (resolution)"
4. *Mode selection*: Different hexagrams for different instruments/voices

Example score annotation:
#+begin_src
[A section] ䷀ 乾 - full assertion, all instruments forte
[B section] ䷁ 坤 - receptive, space, let decay happen
[C section] ䷊ 泰 - call/response, drums+bass meet melody
[Bridge]    ䷋ 否 - deliberate obstruction, tension builder
#+end_src

** Sonification protocol (sketch)

#+begin_src clojure
;; Map MMCA state → Alda/Overtone events
(defn mmca->sound [grid metrics]
  {:pitch    (scale-entropy (:entropy metrics) :minor)
   :rhythm   (density->bpm (:update-rate metrics))
   :timbre   (regime->instrument (:regime metrics))
   :dynamics (diversity->velocity (:motif-count metrics))})

;; Map hexagram → musical mode
(defn hexagram->mode [hex]
  (case (:number hex)
    1  {:mode :lydian :tempo :fast :dynamics :fff}     ; 乾
    2  {:mode :aeolian :tempo :slow :dynamics :pp}     ; 坤
    11 {:mode :dorian :tempo :moderate :dynamics :mf}  ; 泰
    ...))
#+end_src

** Implementation path

1. *Audio display (quick win)*
   - Wire MMCA metrics → Overtone/Alda
   - Real-time sonification of CA runs
   - Hear EoC vs collapse vs stasis

2. *Hexagram → music mapping*
   - Define musical interpretation for each hexagram
   - Add @music-interpretation block to hexagram patterns
   - Test: does 泰 hexagram produce 泰-sounding music?

3. *Composition assistant*
   - Input: desired structure (e.g., "泰 resolving to 坤")
   - Output: suggested musical parameters
   - Test against real compositions (Neubauten, Coleman, etc.)

4. *Aesthetic analysis tool*
   - Input: audio features (spectral, rhythmic, dynamic)
   - Output: hexagram classification
   - Validate: do experts agree with the analysis?

** Xenotype for music

What's the "ant war" equivalent for music?

- Listener response (engagement, attention, emotional arc)
- Band dynamics (does it groove? does it lock?)
- Recording/performance survival (does it get played again?)
- Cultural persistence (does it enter the repertoire?)

These are harder to measure than ant survival, but not impossible:
- Streaming data, skip rates
- Concert recordings, audience response
- Cover versions, citations
- Expert evaluations

** Connection to exotic programming thesis

If the same 泰 structure that predicts EoC in MMCA also predicts:
- Sustainable ant colonies
- Sustainable creative practice
- Compelling music

...then "patterns of improvisation" is genuinely universal.

Music is arguably the *original* domain for this kind of thinking.
Jazz improvisers have always known about 泰 — they just called it
"the pocket" or "the groove."

** Playable arrangements (existing work)

We already have infrastructure for generating physical instrument arrangements:

*** resources/chicago.tex
Chord chart for Chicago tuning (banjo) with:
- Major, minor, Δ7 voicings
- Fret positions and fingering shapes
- Interval structure notation (1-3-5-1, etc.)

*** resources/ii_v_circle.tex
ii-V-I progressions in all 12 keys with:
- Fret diagrams for each chord
- Grip notation (interval structure)
- Voice leading costs (finger movement distance)
- Total cost per progression (optimization target)

This is the "playable arrangements" concept: optimize for physical instrument
constraints while preserving harmonic content.

** Extending to ensembles

The same principles should scale to:

1. *String quartet*
   - Four voices with range/crossing constraints
   - Voice leading costs per part
   - Physical playability (string crossings, positions)
   - Hexagram-guided texture (乾 = tutti assertion, 坤 = solo + silence)

2. *Jazz combo*
   - Rhythm section + horns
   - Comping patterns as 泰 (support without dominate)
   - Solo sections as controlled 乾 (assertion with band 坤 response)

3. *Improvisation group*
   - Real-time hexagram cues
   - Mode shifts as morphisms
   - Collective 泰 as the goal state

** The arrangement compiler (sketch)

#+begin_src clojure
(defn hexagram->arrangement
  "Generate playable arrangement from hexagram + instrumentation"
  [hex instruments]
  (let [texture (hexagram->texture hex)           ; tutti/solo/call-response
        dynamics (hexagram->dynamics hex)          ; fff/pp/mf
        voice-leading (optimize-for-instruments    ; physical constraints
                        (:voicing texture)
                        instruments)]
    {:score voice-leading
     :parts (partition-by-instrument voice-leading instruments)
     :cues (generate-conductor-cues hex)}))
#+end_src

** Integration with EoC sonification

The arrangement compiler connects back to Mission D core:
- MMCA run → hexagram sequence (based on regime)
- Hexagram sequence → arrangement score
- Arrangement score → playable parts

This closes the loop: CA dynamics become performable music.

** Voice leading optimizer (existing code)

~futon5.ii-v-i~ (~src/futon5/ii_v_i.clj~, ~1200 lines) implements dynamic
programming for optimal voice leading:

*** Core algorithm
- ~best-sequence~, ~best-triplet~, ~best-pair~ — DP over chord candidates
- ~candidate-voicings~ — enumerate valid shapes for a chord
- ~transition-cost~ — measure finger movement between shapes
- ~fingering-cost~ — model physical playability (span, stretch, barre)

*** Cost model
- Span penalties (weighted by fret position)
- Barre bonuses (same fret across strings = easier)
- Anchor points (common tones reduce transition cost)
- Per-finger deviation from ideal position

*** Output
- TikZ fret diagrams with fingerings and costs
- Circle-of-fourths generation for all 12 keys
- Total cost = sum of chord costs + transition costs

*** Extension path

This infrastructure generalizes to:

1. *String quartet*: Replace chicago-shapes with string ranges/positions,
   fingering-cost with bowing/position-change costs

2. *Hexagram-guided voicing*: Add hexagram → voicing-preference map,
   e.g., 乾 prefers wide voicings (assertion), 坤 prefers close (receptive)

3. *EoC → arrangement*: Use MMCA regime to select hexagram → voicing style,
   generate physically playable score that embodies the CA dynamics

* Mission E — Collaborative Dynamics (Ensemble / Peeragogy)

Goal: extend the pattern transfer framework to multi-agent collaboration —
jazz ensembles, peer learning groups, any system where multiple agents
improvise together.

** The key distinction

Mission D addresses *individual* instrument constraints (one player's
physical playability). Mission E addresses *ensemble* dynamics — the
relationships between collaborating agents.

** The five-domain table (updated)

| Concept      | MMCA              | Ants                 | Nonstarters          | Music (solo)         | Collaboration        |
|--------------+-------------------+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------|
| 乾 (yang)    | update-prob=1.0   | forage-only          | overbid              | overplaying          | dominating           |
| 坤 (yin)     | update-prob=0.0   | passive follow       | underbid             | underplaying         | passive/silent       |
| 泰 (balance) | EoC zone          | gather-return        | bid/clear rhythm     | call/response        | mutual exchange      |
| Exotype      | sigil → params    | cyberant config      | practice regime      | performance params   | collaboration style  |
| Xenotype     | ant arena         | other colony         | market feedback      | listener response    | group learning       |

** Jazz ensemble as paradigm case

*** The Coleman Quartet (c. 1959-1961)

Classic free jazz quartet as a 泰 system:

- *Ornette Coleman* (alto): melodic 乾, asserting lines, initiating phrases
- *Don Cherry* (pocket trumpet): responsive 乾, answering, complementing
- *Charlie Haden* (bass): harmonic 坤, grounding, sustaining
- *Ed Blackwell/Billy Higgins* (drums): rhythmic 泰, mediating, balancing

The quartet works because the roles create dynamic equilibrium. Pure 乾
(everyone soloing) = chaos. Pure 坤 (everyone waiting) = silence.
泰 = the pocket.

*** The Double Quartet ("Free Jazz", 1961)

Two complete quartets playing simultaneously:
- Left channel: Coleman, Cherry, Haden, Blackwell
- Right channel: Eric Dolphy, Freddie Hubbard, Scott LaFaro, Billy Higgins

This is *two 泰 zones interacting* — like two ant colonies, but cooperating.

Analytical questions:
- When are the two quartets in phase (collective 泰)?
- When does one go 乾 while the other provides 坤 backdrop?
- How do they avoid collision vs. create productive interference?
- What's the xenotype? (Album sales? Critical reception? Influence?)

** Peeragogy as general framework

Jazz is one instance; the general case is *peer collaboration*:

- Peer learning groups
- Open source projects
- Co-authorship
- Jam sessions (musical or otherwise)
- Any system where multiple agents improvise toward shared goals

Peeragogy concepts (to be integrated from external work):
- Roles and role-switching
- Heartbeat (regular rhythms of engagement)
- Carrying capacity (sustainable participation levels)
- Scrapbook (collective memory)
- Roadmap (shared direction without fixed destination)

These map naturally to hexagram dynamics:
- Role-switching = hexagram transitions
- Heartbeat = 泰 rhythm maintenance
- Carrying capacity = avoiding 乾 burnout
- Scrapbook = 坤 receptive memory
- Roadmap = collective VISION in FUTON terms

** Hexagram analysis of collaboration patterns

| Hexagram | Collaboration Pattern | Jazz Analog |
|----------+-----------------------+-------------|
| ䷀ 乾 | All asserting, no listening | Collective solo (chaos) |
| ䷁ 坤 | All waiting, no initiative | Dead air |
| ䷊ 泰 | Dynamic exchange | The pocket / groove |
| ䷋ 否 | Blocked, no flow | Train wreck, lost form |
| ䷄ 需 | Strategic waiting | Trading fours setup |
| ䷌ 同人 | Fellowship, alignment | Tight unison passage |
| ䷍ 大有 | Abundance, flourishing | Peak collective improv |

** Xenotype for collaboration

What's the "ant war" equivalent for human collaboration?

- *Learning outcomes*: Did participants grow?
- *Output quality*: Is the product good?
- *Sustainability*: Can the group continue?
- *Propagation*: Do ideas spread beyond the group?
- *Satisfaction*: Do participants want to continue?

These are harder to measure than ant survival but structurally similar:
external evaluation of whether the collaboration "works."

** Implementation sketch

1. *Retrospective analysis*
   - Annotate recordings/transcripts with hexagram labels
   - Track transitions: who triggers 乾→泰, 泰→否, etc.
   - Correlate with outcomes (learning, quality, satisfaction)

2. *Real-time facilitation*
   - Hexagram cues for group process
   - "We're drifting 乾, need more 坤"
   - Role-rotation prompts based on current pattern

3. *Collaboration design*
   - Structure sessions with hexagram arcs
   - Plan 乾 openings, 泰 development, 坤 integration phases
   - Match participant styles to needed roles

** Connection to ant tournaments

The Codex tournament (CT-stacks vs compiled configs) is structurally
similar to ensemble dynamics:

- CT-stack = role-differentiated ensemble (each hexagram = different voice)
- Compiled config = blended ensemble (merged parameters, less distinct roles)

If CT-stacks outperform compiled configs, that's evidence for the value
of *distinct roles* in collaboration — supporting the Peeragogy insight
that differentiated contributions outperform homogenized participation.

** TODO: Import Peeragogy materials

External work to integrate:
- Peeragogy Handbook patterns
- Role/antipattern analysis
- Case studies from peer learning projects

This would ground Mission E in existing collaborative practice research.

* Mission F — Q&A Agents and Mathematical Discovery

Goal: extend pattern transfer from AIF ants to Fulab agents to Q&A agents,
realizing Turing's 1951 vision of machines that "converse with each other
to sharpen their wits" — and ultimately building a mathematical discovery
engine.

** The transfer chain

#+begin_src
AIF Ants → Fulab Agents → Q&A Agents → Math Discovery
   ↑            ↑              ↑              ↑
 (done)    (similar arch)  (Turing '51)   (the prize)
#+end_src

*** Step 1: AIF Ants (validated)
- Cyberant adapter translates exotypes → AIF configs
- Xenotype evaluation via ant arena / colony wars
- Early results: cyberants beat AIF baseline
- 泰 zone predicts sustainable foraging behavior

*** Step 2: Fulab Agents (next)
- Fulab architecture closely resembles AIF
- Same precision/policy/adaptation structure
- Transfer should be straightforward
- Xenotype: can agents solve Fulab challenges?

*** Step 3: Q&A Agents (LEAPQA / SFI vision)
- Stack Exchange as training ground (18M questions, 13M answered)
- Agents gain fitness by asking and answering questions
- TPG-like composition: teams of interlinked rules
- IAD framework (Ostrom): hexagrams as institutional rules
- Xenotype: reputation, problem-solving success

*** Step 4: Mathematical Discovery
- Q&A agents applied to mathematical domains
- Kolmogorov calculus of problems: Q ⊢ A
- Pólya heuristic as morphism: hard problem → easier problem
- Discovery = finding new Q that yields new A
- Xenotype: provable theorems, novel conjectures

** Architectural correspondence

| Component | AIF Ants | Fulab | Q&A Agents | Math Discovery |
|-----------+----------+-------+------------+----------------|
| State | position, cargo, hunger | task state | knowledge state | proof state |
| Action | forage, return, hold | API calls | ask, answer, vote | conjecture, prove |
| Observation | pheromone, food, walls | responses | other Q&A, votes | counterexamples |
| Policy | foraging strategy | task selection | question strategy | search heuristics |
| Precision | env vs internal weight | confidence | certainty weighting | rigor level |
| Xenotype | survival, score | task success | reputation | theorems proved |

** Hexagram interpretation for Q&A

| Hexagram | Q&A Behavior |
|----------+--------------|
| ䷀ 乾 | Asserting answers without reading the question |
| ䷁ 坤 | Reading without contributing |
| ䷊ 泰 | Dialogic exchange: ask clarifying Qs, provide scaffolded As |
| ䷋ 否 | Stuck: question unclear, answer unhelpful |
| ䷄ 需 | Strategic waiting: let the question mature |
| ䷌ 同人 | Agreement: converging on consensus answer |

The 泰 zone for Q&A agents:
- ask-rate ∈ [0.3, 0.7] (not just lurking, not just posting)
- answer-confidence ∈ [0.3, 0.7] (not overclaiming, not too tentative)
- context-attention ∈ [0.3, 0.7] (attending to discussion, not ignoring)

** Turing's 1951 Vision

From "Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory":

"What we want is a machine that can learn from experience...
[machines] might still be made to rival [humans] in chess.
This... could be done fairly easily by... letting them play
against each other... with a mechanism for intercommunication.
They could ... converse with each other to sharpen their wits."

This is exactly the xenotype framework:
- Agents play against each other (ant war, Q&A competition)
- Intercommunication (shared knowledge base, Q&A threads)
- Sharpening wits (evolution toward better patterns)

** Kolmogorov connection

The arrow work (M9.5/M9.6) directly supports this:
- Terms as knowledge representations
- Normalization as inference
- Mining arrows from corpora (Stack Exchange → formal patterns)

Q ⊢ A in Kolmogorov's sense: a well-posed question *proves* its answer.
The agent's job: learn to pose well-posed questions.

** Koans as curriculum

"Stepping stones, starting from simplest possible tasks and growing in
complexity" (Arthur & Polak, SFI 2004):

1. Trivial koans: pattern matching, simple lookup
2. Basic inference: one-step deduction
3. Multi-step: chaining inferences
4. Creative: generating new questions
5. Discovery: questions that yield novel theorems

Hexagram transitions map the curriculum:
- 坤 (receptive learning) → 泰 (dialogic practice) → 乾 (creative contribution)

** Implementation path

1. *Fulab adapter* (immediate)
   - Mirror cyberant adapter for Fulab architecture
   - Validate transfer: do 泰-configured agents perform well?

2. *Q&A simulation environment*
   - Synthetic Stack Exchange with bot participants
   - Reputation as xenotype fitness
   - Simple koans as initial content

3. *Knowledge extraction* (T1 from LEAPQA)
   - Stack Exchange → formal representations
   - Argument modeling, semantic structure
   - Feed into agent knowledge bases

4. *Heuristic reasoning* (T2 from LEAPQA)
   - Agents reason over extracted knowledge
   - Pólya-style problem transformation
   - Generate questions that lead to answers

5. *Mathematical domain*
   - Apply to formal math Q&A (MathOverflow, Lean prover)
   - Conjecture generation
   - Proof search guided by hexagram heuristics

** Risk and reward

Risk: Each step in the transfer chain could fail.
- Fulab might not transfer cleanly
- Q&A dynamics might be fundamentally different
- Mathematical discovery might require something we don't have

Reward: If it works, we have:
- A general methodology for agent design across domains
- A path to Turing's vision of self-improving AI
- Potential for genuine mathematical discovery
- Validation that "patterns of improvisation" are universal

** SFI pitch (updated)

"In 2019 we proposed agent-based Q&A learning. The infrastructure didn't
exist. Now it does:

- MMCA provides evolutionary search over agent configurations
- Cyberant adapter demonstrates AIF transfer (validated on ants)
- Hexagram framework provides institutional rules (IAD equivalent)
- Xenotype evaluation closes the learning loop
- Arrow infrastructure supports Kolmogorov-style reasoning

We request support to extend the transfer chain: ants → Fulab → Q&A → math.
Each step is testable. If transfer fails, we learn where. If it succeeds,
we approach Turing's 1951 vision."
