* Edge of Chaos (EoC) Hypotheses

EoC = Edge of Chaos.

** CA / Exotype hypotheses

- EoC emerges when exotype rewrite pressure is strong enough to preserve diversity
  but not so strong that it collapses into “magma” or static attractors.
- EoC corresponds to exotypes that preserve multiple competing local motifs rather
  than enforcing a single attractor (metastable interactions).
- Phenotype coupling is a key dial: soft constraints (not hard resets) sustain EoC.
- Certain sigil families may cluster near EoC (controlled mix + low rotation + mid thresholds).
- Nomination gaps suggest EoC lives on a thin manifold; robustness across contexts
  is part of exotype “goodness.”

** CA / Exotype validation ideas

- Sweep `update-prob` × `mix-mode` × `match-threshold` to map the EoC manifold.
- Track stability across context schedules (lock-0/1/2) to quantify fragility.
- Compare EoC candidates by robustness to perturbations vs degeneracy rates.

* EoC ↔ Cyberants hypotheses

- Both domains reward sustained adaptability: EoC in CA parallels “stable survival
  + continued exploration” in ants.
- EoC sigils may encode “controlled perturbation” that maps to exploration–
  exploitation balance in ant policies.
- Robust EoC exotypes should generalize across contexts; analogously, cyberants
  should generalize across grid layouts and food distributions.
- EoC-driving morphisms could become policy adjustment operators (mode shifts,
  hunger/tau coupling), acting as regime shifters in ants.
- Caveat: some EoC sigils may amplify churn without utility; cross-domain checks
  should test correlation with survival/score improvements.

** EoC ↔ Cyberants validation ideas

- Pick a small EoC-exotype set and test against baseline AIF ants for survival.
- Measure transfer: do EoC sigils improve score stability across varied maps?
- Identify “busy but useless” cases where EoC ≠ ant utility.
