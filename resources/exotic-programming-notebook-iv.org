* Mission A — Cyberant Pattern Programs (Pilot)

Goal: validate that pattern-programmed cyberants can be compiled, run, and
evaluated reproducibly, and that the module wiring (policy/precision/sense/adapt)
matters.

** Protocol

1) Inputs
- Pattern ids with @ant-interpretation blocks (hexagrams in ~futon3/library/iching~).
- Optional base sigil for defaults.
- Program map: ~{:policy ... :precision ... :pattern-sense ... :adapt ...}~.

2) Compilation
- Use ~futon5.adapters.cyberant/pattern-program->cyberant~ to build a composite
  cyberant config.
- Record provenance per module (pattern id + title + source path).

3) Execution (ants sim)
- Fixed scenario (grid size, food layout, pheromone decay).
- Run length: 500 ticks (pilot), 10 seeds.
- Compare against baseline AIF ants and a "single-pattern" cyberant.

4) Evaluation
- Survival time (mean + variance).
- Food returned per tick.
- Pheromone efficiency (food per pheromone unit).
- Stability: variance of hunger/cargo over time.
- Qualitative: snapshot traces for a few seeds.

5) Logging + artifacts
- Save compiled cyberant EDN for each run.
- Save run summary table (CSV/EDN) with metrics and seed.
- Save one trace snapshot per condition (for visual inspection).

** Pilot matrix (first pass)

- Program A (EoC-driven):
  :policy iching/hexagram-44-gou
  :precision iching/hexagram-52-gen
  :pattern-sense iching/hexagram-57-xun
  :adapt iching/hexagram-43-guai

- Program B (cooling / restraint):
  :policy iching/hexagram-05-xu
  :precision iching/hexagram-52-gen
  :pattern-sense iching/hexagram-57-xun
  :adapt iching/hexagram-12-pi

- Baseline: AIF ants + single-pattern cyberant (choose one hexagram).

** Expected signal

- Program A should be more exploratory (higher movement, higher pheromone use).
- Program B should be more stable (lower variance, slower decay).
- If both beat baseline in survival, pattern-program wiring is validated.

** Pilot note (first run)

Observed in viz logs: cyberants are active and lead on score + hive reserves
around tick 195–200.

#+begin_src
Tick 195 | Scores Cyber 150.24 vs AIF 138.79 | Hive Z:17.49 A:6.04 | Pop Z:06 A:06 | ...

** Pilot note (sigil vs hexagram)

In a sigil vs hexagram run, sigils outperformed the hexagram cyberants.

#+begin_src
Tick 200 | Scores Cyber 119.02 vs Sigil 135.15 | G_ema 2.959 | Hive Z:0.00 S:0.00 | Pop Z:06 S:06 | ...
#+end_src

Set used for the 50-run comparison:
- Hexagrams: 44 (gou), 57 (xun), 52 (gen), 43 (guai), 11 (tai)
- Sigils: 工 土 上 下 升

** Stacked 5-on-5 results (hex vs sigil)

Compiled stacking (merge after compile):
- Mean score: Hex 133.26 vs Sigil 140.80
- Win rate: Hex 3/10 vs Sigil 7/10

CT stacking (merge at module level):
- Mean score: Hex 135.00 vs Sigil 140.60
- Win rate: Hex 21/50 vs Sigil 29/50

Note: CT stacking materially improved hex win rate even though sigils still lead
on mean score. This supports the idea that diagram-level composition carries
useful signal.

** Next step

Use cyberant regimes as a xenotype: treat ant survival + stability metrics as
external evaluation signals for MMCA runs (cross-domain viability check).

** Xenotype sketch (ants → MMCA)

- Fixed horizon: T=200 ticks per run.
- Survival rate: fraction of runs where the queen survives to T.
- Early failure: time-to-queen-starvation (only when queen dies before T).
- Sustained return: food returned per tick (mean + variance).
- Stability: hunger + reserve variance (avoid brittle spikes).
- Exploration balance: pheromone efficiency + movement diversity.
- Robustness: variance across seeds/maps.

** Big-picture snapshot (where we are now)

- Exotypes (sigils) are operational and stable.
- Xenotypes now have a concrete instantiation via cyberant regimes.
- End-to-end pipeline works: patterns → cyberants → ant sim → metrics.
- Early evidence: sigil-based cyberants are ahead of hexagrams on the current set.
- Next integration task: plug ant xenotype scores into MMCA as a slow evaluator
  (every N exotype gens), using fixed-horizon metrics.

** MMCA hook plan (ant xenotype)

1) Trigger point
- Run ant xenotype every N exotype generations (e.g., N=100).
- Input: top-K exotypes (by current MMCA score) + a few random controls.

2) Adapter
- Map exotype → cyberant config (sigil-based by default).
- Optionally allow hexagram mapping as a comparison arm.

3) Battery
- Fixed horizon T=200 ticks.
- 3 maps × 5 seeds (15 runs per exotype).
- Record survival rate + early failure time + stability metrics.

4) Scoring
- Produce a xenotype score vector (not scalar) per exotype:
  {:survival-rate .. :early-fail-mean .. :return-rate .. :stability .. :robustness ..}
- Collapse to a conservative scalar only for culling (e.g., survival-rate gate).

5) Integration
- Penalize exotypes that consistently fail survival gate.
- Maintain a portfolio of xenotype-viable exotypes (top-K per regime).
- Log xenotype audits alongside exotype lineage for later analysis.

* Mission C — Nonstarter Transfer (Speculative)

Goal: test whether the 泰 pattern (and hexagram structure generally) predicts
sustainable creative practice in the nonstarter/art market domain.

** The three-domain transfer hypothesis

If "patterns of improvisation" are real, the same structure should work across:

| Concept      | MMCA              | Ants                 | Nonstarters          |
|--------------+-------------------+----------------------+----------------------|
| 乾 (yang)    | update-prob=1.0   | forage-only, starve  | overbid, burnout     |
| 坤 (yin)     | update-prob=0.0   | passive trail-follow | underbid, stall      |
| 泰 (balance) | EoC zone          | gather-return cycle  | bid/clear rhythm     |
| Exotype      | sigil → params    | cyberant config      | practice regime      |
| Xenotype     | ant arena         | other colony (war)   | market feedback      |

** Nonstarter domain concepts

*** Exotype (internal practice regime)
- Bid rate: how often you propose/start new work
- Clear rate: how often you finish/ship
- Hold capacity: WIP limits, parallel projects
- Precision: how much market signal you attend to

*** Xenotype (external evaluation)
- Market clears: do your bids get accepted? (commissions, grants, sales)
- Survival: sustaining practice over time (not quitting)
- Stability: consistent output without boom/bust cycles
- GFE accumulation: genuine frontier expansion (new capabilities, reach)
- Robustness: works across contexts (commissions, spec, grants, day-job)

** The 泰 prediction

Pure 乾 artist: starts everything, finishes nothing, burns out
Pure 坤 artist: waits for permission, never ships, stalls out
泰 artist: balanced bid/clear cycle, sustainable output, survives

The 泰 zone in nonstarter terms:
- bid-rate ∈ [0.3, 0.7] (not overbidding, not underbidding)
- clear-rate ∈ [0.3, 0.7] (finishing enough to learn, not rushing)
- market-attention ∈ [0.3, 0.7] (responsive but not reactive)

** Hexagram interpretations for practice

Some candidate mappings:

- ䷊ 泰 (11): Dynamic balance — the sustainable practice regime
- ䷋ 否 (12): Obstruction — when bid/clear cycle breaks down
- ䷀ 乾 (1): Pure assertion — good for launches, bad for maintenance
- ䷁ 坤 (2): Pure reception — good for learning phases, bad if stuck
- ䷄ 需 (5): Waiting — strategic pause, not stall
- ䷝ 離 (30): Clinging/Clarity — focused execution sprint

** Testing approach

Unlike MMCA and ants, we can't run controlled experiments on humans.
But we can:

1. Retrospective analysis: map past practice regimes to hexagrams,
   check if 泰-like periods correlate with sustainable output

2. Prospective tracking: use bid/clear logging (futon5a/track.clj)
   to monitor practice regime, watch for 乾/坤 drift

3. Intervention design: when stuck, consult hexagram for diagnosis
   (am I too 乾? too 坤?) and prescribed shift

4. Cross-check: do the same patterns that work in ant tournaments
   predict good practice regimes? (indirect validation)

** The meta-question

If transfer works across all three domains, what does that mean?

Hypothesis: the intervention/observation balance (yang/yin, creative/receptive)
is a *universal* structure that applies wherever agents interact with
environments. The I Ching encoded this 3000 years ago; we're rediscovering
it through computational experiments.

This would validate "exotic programming" as a genuine methodology:
patterns discovered in one domain (CA) transfer to others (ants, art)
through the CT interpretation layer.

** Connection to job search

The "sustainability meta-probe" (job search as nonstarter) is itself
a test case:

- Too 乾: spray applications everywhere, no focus, burnout
- Too 坤: wait for perfect opportunity, never apply, stall
- 泰: balanced search with clear criteria, sustainable pace

GFE evaluation of job opportunities follows the same pattern:
attend to market signal (offers, interviews) but don't be purely reactive.

* Mission D — Music Domain Transfer

Goal: extend the pattern transfer framework to music — both for *analyzing*
existing music (aesthetic lens) and *creating* new music (composition tool).

** Existing infrastructure (from AGENTS.md)

FUTON5 already plans music integration:

- Milestone B: Alda + Overtone integration
- Section 4.1: "Let operators sound their transformations"
- "Audible debugging" of pattern transforms
- Link CA states to sound patterns (sonification)

** Audio display for EoC

Immediate goal: *hear* edge-of-chaos rather than just see it.

Sonification mapping ideas:
- Entropy → pitch range (low entropy = narrow, high = wide)
- Motif diversity → harmonic complexity
- Update frequency → rhythm density
- Spatial clustering → stereo positioning
- Regime transitions → timbral shifts

This gives a direct perceptual channel for EoC detection. Some dynamics
might be easier to hear than see (e.g., subtle phase relationships).

** The four-domain table (updated)

| Concept      | MMCA              | Ants                 | Nonstarters          | Music                |
|--------------+-------------------+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------|
| 乾 (yang)    | update-prob=1.0   | forage-only, starve  | overbid, burnout     | overplaying, no space|
| 坤 (yin)     | update-prob=0.0   | passive trail-follow | underbid, stall      | underplaying, sparse |
| 泰 (balance) | EoC zone          | gather-return cycle  | bid/clear rhythm     | call/response groove |
| Exotype      | sigil → params    | cyberant config      | practice regime      | performance params   |
| Xenotype     | ant arena         | other colony (war)   | market feedback      | listener/band response|

** Aesthetic analysis: Neubauten vs Coleman

Both are 泰-zone artists operating at edge-of-chaos, but in different parameter spaces:

*** Einstürzende Neubauten
- Industrial materials, extreme timbres
- 乾 on *texture* (aggressive intervention on sound)
- 泰 on *form* (structured chaos, not pure noise)
- High update-prob on timbre, moderate on rhythm
- Xenotype: audience endurance, mosh pit dynamics

*** Ornette Coleman
- Harmolodic freedom, melodic assertion
- 泰 on *melody* (free but coherent)
- High reception on *group dynamics* (listening-based improv)
- Moderate update-prob, high match-threshold (melodic coherence)
- Xenotype: band response, collective groove

The hexagram lens reveals: *where* is each artist's 泰 zone? What parameters
are they balancing? This is more precise than "they're both experimental."

** Composition/improvisation tool

Use hexagrams as:

1. *Diagnostic*: "This section feels too 乾, needs more 坤"
2. *Prescriptive*: "Try hexagram 57-xùn here: gentle persistence"
3. *Structural*: "A = 乾 (attack), B = 坤 (sustain), C = 泰 (resolution)"
4. *Mode selection*: Different hexagrams for different instruments/voices

Example score annotation:
#+begin_src
[A section] ䷀ 乾 - full assertion, all instruments forte
[B section] ䷁ 坤 - receptive, space, let decay happen
[C section] ䷊ 泰 - call/response, drums+bass meet melody
[Bridge]    ䷋ 否 - deliberate obstruction, tension builder
#+end_src

** Sonification protocol (sketch)

#+begin_src clojure
;; Map MMCA state → Alda/Overtone events
(defn mmca->sound [grid metrics]
  {:pitch    (scale-entropy (:entropy metrics) :minor)
   :rhythm   (density->bpm (:update-rate metrics))
   :timbre   (regime->instrument (:regime metrics))
   :dynamics (diversity->velocity (:motif-count metrics))})

;; Map hexagram → musical mode
(defn hexagram->mode [hex]
  (case (:number hex)
    1  {:mode :lydian :tempo :fast :dynamics :fff}     ; 乾
    2  {:mode :aeolian :tempo :slow :dynamics :pp}     ; 坤
    11 {:mode :dorian :tempo :moderate :dynamics :mf}  ; 泰
    ...))
#+end_src

** Implementation path

1. *Audio display (quick win)*
   - Wire MMCA metrics → Overtone/Alda
   - Real-time sonification of CA runs
   - Hear EoC vs collapse vs stasis

2. *Hexagram → music mapping*
   - Define musical interpretation for each hexagram
   - Add @music-interpretation block to hexagram patterns
   - Test: does 泰 hexagram produce 泰-sounding music?

3. *Composition assistant*
   - Input: desired structure (e.g., "泰 resolving to 坤")
   - Output: suggested musical parameters
   - Test against real compositions (Neubauten, Coleman, etc.)

4. *Aesthetic analysis tool*
   - Input: audio features (spectral, rhythmic, dynamic)
   - Output: hexagram classification
   - Validate: do experts agree with the analysis?

** Xenotype for music

What's the "ant war" equivalent for music?

- Listener response (engagement, attention, emotional arc)
- Band dynamics (does it groove? does it lock?)
- Recording/performance survival (does it get played again?)
- Cultural persistence (does it enter the repertoire?)

These are harder to measure than ant survival, but not impossible:
- Streaming data, skip rates
- Concert recordings, audience response
- Cover versions, citations
- Expert evaluations

** Connection to exotic programming thesis

If the same 泰 structure that predicts EoC in MMCA also predicts:
- Sustainable ant colonies
- Sustainable creative practice
- Compelling music

...then "patterns of improvisation" is genuinely universal.

Music is arguably the *original* domain for this kind of thinking.
Jazz improvisers have always known about 泰 — they just called it
"the pocket" or "the groove."

** Playable arrangements (existing work)

We already have infrastructure for generating physical instrument arrangements:

*** resources/chicago.tex
Chord chart for Chicago tuning (banjo) with:
- Major, minor, Δ7 voicings
- Fret positions and fingering shapes
- Interval structure notation (1-3-5-1, etc.)

*** resources/ii_v_circle.tex
ii-V-I progressions in all 12 keys with:
- Fret diagrams for each chord
- Grip notation (interval structure)
- Voice leading costs (finger movement distance)
- Total cost per progression (optimization target)

This is the "playable arrangements" concept: optimize for physical instrument
constraints while preserving harmonic content.

** Extending to ensembles

The same principles should scale to:

1. *String quartet*
   - Four voices with range/crossing constraints
   - Voice leading costs per part
   - Physical playability (string crossings, positions)
   - Hexagram-guided texture (乾 = tutti assertion, 坤 = solo + silence)

2. *Jazz combo*
   - Rhythm section + horns
   - Comping patterns as 泰 (support without dominate)
   - Solo sections as controlled 乾 (assertion with band 坤 response)

3. *Improvisation group*
   - Real-time hexagram cues
   - Mode shifts as morphisms
   - Collective 泰 as the goal state

** The arrangement compiler (sketch)

#+begin_src clojure
(defn hexagram->arrangement
  "Generate playable arrangement from hexagram + instrumentation"
  [hex instruments]
  (let [texture (hexagram->texture hex)           ; tutti/solo/call-response
        dynamics (hexagram->dynamics hex)          ; fff/pp/mf
        voice-leading (optimize-for-instruments    ; physical constraints
                        (:voicing texture)
                        instruments)]
    {:score voice-leading
     :parts (partition-by-instrument voice-leading instruments)
     :cues (generate-conductor-cues hex)}))
#+end_src

** Integration with EoC sonification

The arrangement compiler connects back to Mission D core:
- MMCA run → hexagram sequence (based on regime)
- Hexagram sequence → arrangement score
- Arrangement score → playable parts

This closes the loop: CA dynamics become performable music.

** Voice leading optimizer (existing code)

~futon5.ii-v-i~ (~src/futon5/ii_v_i.clj~, ~1200 lines) implements dynamic
programming for optimal voice leading:

*** Core algorithm
- ~best-sequence~, ~best-triplet~, ~best-pair~ — DP over chord candidates
- ~candidate-voicings~ — enumerate valid shapes for a chord
- ~transition-cost~ — measure finger movement between shapes
- ~fingering-cost~ — model physical playability (span, stretch, barre)

*** Cost model
- Span penalties (weighted by fret position)
- Barre bonuses (same fret across strings = easier)
- Anchor points (common tones reduce transition cost)
- Per-finger deviation from ideal position

*** Output
- TikZ fret diagrams with fingerings and costs
- Circle-of-fourths generation for all 12 keys
- Total cost = sum of chord costs + transition costs

*** Extension path

This infrastructure generalizes to:

1. *String quartet*: Replace chicago-shapes with string ranges/positions,
   fingering-cost with bowing/position-change costs

2. *Hexagram-guided voicing*: Add hexagram → voicing-preference map,
   e.g., 乾 prefers wide voicings (assertion), 坤 prefers close (receptive)

3. *EoC → arrangement*: Use MMCA regime to select hexagram → voicing style,
   generate physically playable score that embodies the CA dynamics

* Mission E — Collaborative Dynamics (Ensemble / Peeragogy)

Goal: extend the pattern transfer framework to multi-agent collaboration —
jazz ensembles, peer learning groups, any system where multiple agents
improvise together.

** The key distinction

Mission D addresses *individual* instrument constraints (one player's
physical playability). Mission E addresses *ensemble* dynamics — the
relationships between collaborating agents.

** The five-domain table (updated)

| Concept      | MMCA              | Ants                 | Nonstarters          | Music (solo)         | Collaboration        |
|--------------+-------------------+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------|
| 乾 (yang)    | update-prob=1.0   | forage-only          | overbid              | overplaying          | dominating           |
| 坤 (yin)     | update-prob=0.0   | passive follow       | underbid             | underplaying         | passive/silent       |
| 泰 (balance) | EoC zone          | gather-return        | bid/clear rhythm     | call/response        | mutual exchange      |
| Exotype      | sigil → params    | cyberant config      | practice regime      | performance params   | collaboration style  |
| Xenotype     | ant arena         | other colony         | market feedback      | listener response    | group learning       |

** Jazz ensemble as paradigm case

*** The Coleman Quartet (c. 1959-1961)

Classic free jazz quartet as a 泰 system:

- *Ornette Coleman* (alto): melodic 乾, asserting lines, initiating phrases
- *Don Cherry* (pocket trumpet): responsive 乾, answering, complementing
- *Charlie Haden* (bass): harmonic 坤, grounding, sustaining
- *Ed Blackwell/Billy Higgins* (drums): rhythmic 泰, mediating, balancing

The quartet works because the roles create dynamic equilibrium. Pure 乾
(everyone soloing) = chaos. Pure 坤 (everyone waiting) = silence.
泰 = the pocket.

*** The Double Quartet ("Free Jazz", 1961)

Two complete quartets playing simultaneously:
- Left channel: Coleman, Cherry, Haden, Blackwell
- Right channel: Eric Dolphy, Freddie Hubbard, Scott LaFaro, Billy Higgins

This is *two 泰 zones interacting* — like two ant colonies, but cooperating.

Analytical questions:
- When are the two quartets in phase (collective 泰)?
- When does one go 乾 while the other provides 坤 backdrop?
- How do they avoid collision vs. create productive interference?
- What's the xenotype? (Album sales? Critical reception? Influence?)

** Peeragogy as general framework

Jazz is one instance; the general case is *peer collaboration*:

- Peer learning groups
- Open source projects
- Co-authorship
- Jam sessions (musical or otherwise)
- Any system where multiple agents improvise toward shared goals

Peeragogy concepts (to be integrated from external work):
- Roles and role-switching
- Heartbeat (regular rhythms of engagement)
- Carrying capacity (sustainable participation levels)
- Scrapbook (collective memory)
- Roadmap (shared direction without fixed destination)

These map naturally to hexagram dynamics:
- Role-switching = hexagram transitions
- Heartbeat = 泰 rhythm maintenance
- Carrying capacity = avoiding 乾 burnout
- Scrapbook = 坤 receptive memory
- Roadmap = collective VISION in FUTON terms

** Hexagram analysis of collaboration patterns

| Hexagram | Collaboration Pattern | Jazz Analog |
|----------+-----------------------+-------------|
| ䷀ 乾 | All asserting, no listening | Collective solo (chaos) |
| ䷁ 坤 | All waiting, no initiative | Dead air |
| ䷊ 泰 | Dynamic exchange | The pocket / groove |
| ䷋ 否 | Blocked, no flow | Train wreck, lost form |
| ䷄ 需 | Strategic waiting | Trading fours setup |
| ䷌ 同人 | Fellowship, alignment | Tight unison passage |
| ䷍ 大有 | Abundance, flourishing | Peak collective improv |

** Xenotype for collaboration

What's the "ant war" equivalent for human collaboration?

- *Learning outcomes*: Did participants grow?
- *Output quality*: Is the product good?
- *Sustainability*: Can the group continue?
- *Propagation*: Do ideas spread beyond the group?
- *Satisfaction*: Do participants want to continue?

These are harder to measure than ant survival but structurally similar:
external evaluation of whether the collaboration "works."

** Implementation sketch

1. *Retrospective analysis*
   - Annotate recordings/transcripts with hexagram labels
   - Track transitions: who triggers 乾→泰, 泰→否, etc.
   - Correlate with outcomes (learning, quality, satisfaction)

2. *Real-time facilitation*
   - Hexagram cues for group process
   - "We're drifting 乾, need more 坤"
   - Role-rotation prompts based on current pattern

3. *Collaboration design*
   - Structure sessions with hexagram arcs
   - Plan 乾 openings, 泰 development, 坤 integration phases
   - Match participant styles to needed roles

** Connection to ant tournaments

The Codex tournament (CT-stacks vs compiled configs) is structurally
similar to ensemble dynamics:

- CT-stack = role-differentiated ensemble (each hexagram = different voice)
- Compiled config = blended ensemble (merged parameters, less distinct roles)

If CT-stacks outperform compiled configs, that's evidence for the value
of *distinct roles* in collaboration — supporting the Peeragogy insight
that differentiated contributions outperform homogenized participation.

** TODO: Import Peeragogy materials

External work to integrate:
- Peeragogy Handbook patterns
- Role/antipattern analysis
- Case studies from peer learning projects

This would ground Mission E in existing collaborative practice research.

* Mission F — Q&A Agents and Mathematical Discovery

Goal: extend pattern transfer from AIF ants to Fulab agents to Q&A agents,
realizing Turing's 1951 vision of machines that "converse with each other
to sharpen their wits" — and ultimately building a mathematical discovery
engine.

** The transfer chain

#+begin_src
AIF Ants → Fulab Agents → Q&A Agents → Math Discovery
   ↑            ↑              ↑              ↑
 (done)    (similar arch)  (Turing '51)   (the prize)
#+end_src

*** Step 1: AIF Ants (validated)
- Cyberant adapter translates exotypes → AIF configs
- Xenotype evaluation via ant arena / colony wars
- Early results: cyberants beat AIF baseline
- 泰 zone predicts sustainable foraging behavior

*** Step 2: Fulab Agents (next)
- Fulab architecture closely resembles AIF
- Same precision/policy/adaptation structure
- Transfer should be straightforward
- Xenotype: can agents solve Fulab challenges?

*** Step 3: Q&A Agents (LEAPQA / SFI vision)
- Stack Exchange as training ground (18M questions, 13M answered)
- Agents gain fitness by asking and answering questions
- TPG-like composition: teams of interlinked rules
- IAD framework (Ostrom): hexagrams as institutional rules
- Xenotype: reputation, problem-solving success

*** Step 4: Mathematical Discovery
- Q&A agents applied to mathematical domains
- Kolmogorov calculus of problems: Q ⊢ A
- Pólya heuristic as morphism: hard problem → easier problem
- Discovery = finding new Q that yields new A
- Xenotype: provable theorems, novel conjectures

** Architectural correspondence

| Component | AIF Ants | Fulab | Q&A Agents | Math Discovery |
|-----------+----------+-------+------------+----------------|
| State | position, cargo, hunger | task state | knowledge state | proof state |
| Action | forage, return, hold | API calls | ask, answer, vote | conjecture, prove |
| Observation | pheromone, food, walls | responses | other Q&A, votes | counterexamples |
| Policy | foraging strategy | task selection | question strategy | search heuristics |
| Precision | env vs internal weight | confidence | certainty weighting | rigor level |
| Xenotype | survival, score | task success | reputation | theorems proved |

** Hexagram interpretation for Q&A

| Hexagram | Q&A Behavior |
|----------+--------------|
| ䷀ 乾 | Asserting answers without reading the question |
| ䷁ 坤 | Reading without contributing |
| ䷊ 泰 | Dialogic exchange: ask clarifying Qs, provide scaffolded As |
| ䷋ 否 | Stuck: question unclear, answer unhelpful |
| ䷄ 需 | Strategic waiting: let the question mature |
| ䷌ 同人 | Agreement: converging on consensus answer |

The 泰 zone for Q&A agents:
- ask-rate ∈ [0.3, 0.7] (not just lurking, not just posting)
- answer-confidence ∈ [0.3, 0.7] (not overclaiming, not too tentative)
- context-attention ∈ [0.3, 0.7] (attending to discussion, not ignoring)

** Turing's 1951 Vision

From "Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory":

"What we want is a machine that can learn from experience...
[machines] might still be made to rival [humans] in chess.
This... could be done fairly easily by... letting them play
against each other... with a mechanism for intercommunication.
They could ... converse with each other to sharpen their wits."

This is exactly the xenotype framework:
- Agents play against each other (ant war, Q&A competition)
- Intercommunication (shared knowledge base, Q&A threads)
- Sharpening wits (evolution toward better patterns)

** Kolmogorov connection

The arrow work (M9.5/M9.6) directly supports this:
- Terms as knowledge representations
- Normalization as inference
- Mining arrows from corpora (Stack Exchange → formal patterns)

Q ⊢ A in Kolmogorov's sense: a well-posed question *proves* its answer.
The agent's job: learn to pose well-posed questions.

** Koans as curriculum

"Stepping stones, starting from simplest possible tasks and growing in
complexity" (Arthur & Polak, SFI 2004):

1. Trivial koans: pattern matching, simple lookup
2. Basic inference: one-step deduction
3. Multi-step: chaining inferences
4. Creative: generating new questions
5. Discovery: questions that yield novel theorems

Hexagram transitions map the curriculum:
- 坤 (receptive learning) → 泰 (dialogic practice) → 乾 (creative contribution)

** Implementation path

1. *Fulab adapter* (immediate)
   - Mirror cyberant adapter for Fulab architecture
   - Validate transfer: do 泰-configured agents perform well?

2. *Q&A simulation environment*
   - Synthetic Stack Exchange with bot participants
   - Reputation as xenotype fitness
   - Simple koans as initial content

3. *Knowledge extraction* (T1 from LEAPQA)
   - Stack Exchange → formal representations
   - Argument modeling, semantic structure
   - Feed into agent knowledge bases

4. *Heuristic reasoning* (T2 from LEAPQA)
   - Agents reason over extracted knowledge
   - Pólya-style problem transformation
   - Generate questions that lead to answers

5. *Mathematical domain*
   - Apply to formal math Q&A (MathOverflow, Lean prover)
   - Conjecture generation
   - Proof search guided by hexagram heuristics

** Risk and reward

Risk: Each step in the transfer chain could fail.
- Fulab might not transfer cleanly
- Q&A dynamics might be fundamentally different
- Mathematical discovery might require something we don't have

Reward: If it works, we have:
- A general methodology for agent design across domains
- A path to Turing's vision of self-improving AI
- Potential for genuine mathematical discovery
- Validation that "patterns of improvisation" are universal

** SFI pitch (updated)

"In 2019 we proposed agent-based Q&A learning. The infrastructure didn't
exist. Now it does:

- MMCA provides evolutionary search over agent configurations
- Cyberant adapter demonstrates AIF transfer (validated on ants)
- Hexagram framework provides institutional rules (IAD equivalent)
- Xenotype evaluation closes the learning loop
- Arrow infrastructure supports Kolmogorov-style reasoning

We request support to extend the transfer chain: ants → Fulab → Q&A → math.
Each step is testable. If transfer fails, we learn where. If it succeeds,
we approach Turing's 1951 vision."
