# Mission: Fulab Wiring Survey

**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Status:** Ready
**Blocked by:** None

## Summary

Survey existing MMCA wiring diagrams, extract reusable primitives, and
define clear fulab wiring mission for compression stability.

Scope: survey only — no new algorithms. Catalog what exists in
data/wiring-rules/, identify common subgraph patterns, assess which
wirings produce stable dynamics under the SCI detection pipeline.

## Key Files

- `docs/Mission-1-fulab-wiring.md` (proposal)
- `data/wiring-rules/` (existing diagrams)
