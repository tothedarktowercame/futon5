# Next Steps: L5‑creative Follow‑up

Date: 2026-01-25

## Goal
Preserve the promising phenotype/genotype behavior seen in L5‑creative‑seed‑352362012 while understanding the role of exotype turbulence.

## Proposed Steps
1) **Layered health profile**
   - Report genotype/phenotype/exotype separately (change, entropy, barcode).
   - Allow exotype‑chaotic if phenotype stays non‑barcode and genotype remains structured.

2) **Gate threshold sweep (local)**
   - Test diversity threshold values (e.g., 0.4, 0.5, 0.6) on seed 352362012.
   - Track phenotype band score + barcode detection.

3) **Creative‑path activation audit**
   - Log diversity scores and gate decisions to see how often the creative path is chosen.
   - Verify the creative path is actually engaged in this run.

4) **Seed stability check**
   - Re‑run L5 creative on nearby seeds (e.g., 352362013, 352362111) to test robustness.

5) **Exotype turbulence measure**
   - Add a simple exotype change‑rate + diversity metric per generation.
   - Correlate exotype turbulence with phenotype stability.

## Desired Outcome
A reproducible configuration where:
- Phenotype is non‑barcode and in EoC‑ish range.
- Genotype shows coherent structure.
- Exotype may be turbulent but not destabilizing.
