# Missions, Excursions, and Reports — Linearized Index

Date: 2026-01-26

This index linearizes mission/excursion docs and reports. Items marked **DONE**
are explicitly completed or delivered; everything else reflects the latest
stated status in the source files.

## Notes

- “DONE” for technotes/reports indicates document delivery, not necessarily
  mission completion.
- Mission status lines above are sourced from `docs/Excursions-overview.md`
  and explicit status declarations in the mission files.
- If you want additional statuses (e.g., per‑stage DONE/IN‑PROGRESS) we can
  extend this into a stage‑level tracker.
