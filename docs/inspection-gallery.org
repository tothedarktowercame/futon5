#+TITLE: Visual Inspection Gallery: Legacy vs Prototype vs Boundary Guardian
#+DATE: 2026-01-25

* Overview

This gallery compares triptychs from three wiring types:
- *Legacy 工*: Known-good baseline (update-prob=0.5, match-threshold=0.44)
- *Prototype-001*: Graph-based creative-peng wiring
- *Boundary Guardian*: Hybrid using legacy as base with creative XOR in moderate diversity

Each triptych shows: Genotype | Phenotype | Exotype (left to right)
Time runs top to bottom (100 generations).

* Key Question

Is prototype-001 "hot" (galaxy-like) or does it produce genuine EoC (coral-reef)?

Metrics suggest prototype-001 has *better* band scores than legacy:
- 26% moderate columns vs 7%
- Band score 0.260 vs 0.070

But visual inspection is needed to confirm.

** Prototype-001 (seed 352362012)

- Final change rate: ~0.12
- Moderate columns: 31%
- Band score: 0.310 ("has-active-bands")
- Widest band: 12 columns

* Questions for Visual Review

1. Does prototype-001 look like "galaxy" (sparse, collapsed) or "coral reef" (dense, branching)?

2. Are there visible vertical bands of activity in the phenotype?

3. Does the exotype layer (right panel) show structure or noise?

4. How does Boundary Guardian compare visually to pure legacy?
